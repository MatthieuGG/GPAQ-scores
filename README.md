# How to obtain MET/min/week using GPAQ scores ?
GPAQ questionnaires assess the physical activity (PA) behavior during work, displacements or hobbies.
You can then obtain the number of minutes per week spend practicing moderate (MVPA), intense (VPA), or no physical activity; then translate it into MET/min/week.  
  
To do so, you need to:
* transpose the questionnaires into .csv files (see model provided)
* put all the .csv files in the same folder
* use the code provided on your transposed .csv files to obtain the energy expenditure over a week
